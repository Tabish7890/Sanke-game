                    kind of learning that takes place via the Internet. Online learning gives educators an opportunity
                    to reach students who may not be able to enroll in a traditional classroom course and supports
                    students who need to work on their own schedule and at their own pace. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Online learning involves courses offered by primary institutions that are 100%
                virtual. Online learning, or virtual classes offered over the internet, is contrasted with traditional
                courses taken in a brick-and-mortar school building. It is a development in distance education that
                expanded in the 1990s with the spread of the commercial Internet and the World Wide Web. The learner
                experience is typically asynchronous but may also incorporate synchronous elements. The vast majority of
                institutions utilize a learning management system for the administration of online courses. As theories
                of distance education evolve, digital technologies to support learning and pedagogy continue to
                transform as well. The National Education Policy of India 2020 (NEP 2020), which was started by the
                Union Cabinet of India on 29 July 2020, outlines the vision of new education system of India.[1] The new
                policy replaces the previous National Policy on Education, 1986.[a] The policy is a comprehensive
                framework for elementary education to higher education as well as vocational training in both rural and
                urban India. The policy aims to transform India's education system by 2030.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag">Focus on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy : The policy accords the highest
                priority to achieving Foundational Literacy and Numeracy by all students by Grade 3. The policy states,
                "The highest priority of the education system will be to achieve universal foundational literacy and
                numeracy in primary school by 2025. The rest of this Policy will become relevant for our students only
                if this most basic learning requirement (i.e., reading, writing, and arithmetic at the foundational
                level) is first achieved. To this end, a National Mission on Foundational Literacy and Numeracy will be
                set up by the Ministry of Education on priority. Accordingly, all State/UT governments will immediately
                prepare an implementation plan for attaining universal foundational literacy and numeracy in all primary
                schools, identifying stage-wise targets and goals to be achieved by 2025, and closely tracking and
                monitoring progress of the same".
                Foundational Stage: This is further subdivided into two parts: 3 years of preschool or anganwadi,
                followed by classes 1 and 2 in primary school. This will cover children of ages 3–8 years. The focus of
                studies will be in activity-based learning.
                Preparatory Stage: Classes 3 to 5, which will cover the ages of 8–10 years. It will gradually introduce
                subjects like speaking, reading, writing, physical education, languages, art, science and mathematics.
                Middle Stage: Classes 6 to 8, covering children between ages 11 and 13. It will introduce students to
                the more abstract concepts in subjects of mathematics, sciences, social sciences, arts and humanities.
                Secondary Stage: Classes 9 to 12, covering the ages of 14–18 years. It is again subdivided into two
                parts: classes 9 and 10 covering the first phase while classes 11 and 12 covering the second phase.
                These 4 years of study are intended to inculcate multidisciplinary study, coupled with depth and
                critical thinking. Multiple options of subjects will be provided.
                Instead of exams being held every academic year, school students will only attend three exams, in
                classes 2, 5 and 8.

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Lets Grow together</p>
            <p class="sectionSubTag">Early childhood development (ECD) is a significant phase of growth and development
                that influences outcomes across an individual’s entire life and provides an important window of
                opportunity to prepare the foundation for lifelong learning and participation (World Health Organization
                [WHO], 2011). New government policy in Malawi sets out to increase the number of children with
                disabilities accessing ECD, particularly in community-based childcare centres (CBCCs). As such the UK
                Department for International Development, which has Malawi as one of its key target countries, funded
                the ‘Let’s Grow Together’ project, a three year (2015 to 2018) multi-agency study that seeks to promote
                the inclusion of children with disabilities in Community Based Childcare Centres (CBCCs) in a rural
                district of Southern Malawi. To help explore this, 16 parents of children with disabilities who were
                attending ten CBCCs and 24 caregivers volunteering at the centres were asked to share their perceptions
                and experiences of inclusion of children with disabilities, within both the CBCCs and within their wider
                communities. This included their perceptions of the young children’s experiences. This was undertaken
                through a community-based participatory research (CBPR) approach.

                The paper describes the CBPR element in a multi-method study undertaken in ten CBCCs in 2016–17,
                outlines the context and methodology applied, shares the findings of the CBPR element and discusses the
                implications within the ‘local’ context. Overall, the findings have helped to build a picture of current
                provision of early childhood development and education (ECDE) services for pre-school children with
                disabilities in Malawi, and have contributed to the development of an Inclusion Resource Pack, now
                integrated into the basic two-week national training curricula for community-based Early Childhood
                Development (ECD) caregivers. The CBPR element of the wider mixed-methods study offers qualitative
                evidence to the Malawi Government and key stakeholders to understand more fully, the complex dynamics
                that enable or inhibit quality ECDE for children with disabilities in Southern Malawi.</p>
